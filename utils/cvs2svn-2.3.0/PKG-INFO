Description: cvs2svn_ is a tool for migrating a CVS repository to Subversion_, git_,
        Bazaar_, or Mercurial_. The main design goals are robustness and 100% data
        preservation. cvs2svn can convert just about any CVS repository we've ever
        seen, including gcc, Mozilla, FreeBSD, KDE, GNOME...

        .. _Subversion: http://svn.tigris.org/
        .. _git: http://git-scm.com/
        .. _Bazaar: http://bazaar-vcs.org/
        .. _Mercurial: http://mercurial.selenic.com/
        
        cvs2svn infers what happened in the history of your CVS repository and
        replicates that history as accurately as possible in the target SCM. All
        revisions, branches, tags, log messages, author names, and commit dates are
        converted. cvs2svn deduces what CVS modifications were made at the same time,
        and outputs these modifications grouped together as changesets in the target
        SCM. cvs2svn also deals with many CVS quirks and is highly configurable.
        See the comprehensive `feature list`_.

        Please read the documentation_ carefully before using cvs2svn.
        
        
        Latest development version
        --------------------------
        
        For general use, the most recent released version of cvs2svn is usually the
        best choice. However, if you want to use the newest cvs2svn features or if
        you're debugging or patching cvs2svn, you might want to use the trunk version
        (which is usually quite stable). To do so, use Subversion to check out a
        working copy from http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk/ using a command
        like::
        
        svn co --username=guest http://cvs2svn.tigris.org/svn/cvs2svn/trunk cvs2svn-trunk
        
        (the password is empty; i.e., just press return).
